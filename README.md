# CUNY_SportTeam_Height
Web scraping tool that utilizes colleges athletic men’s and women’s swimming and volleyball teams’ roster pages to web scrape for their name and heights. The roster pages are from five colleges: Brooklyn College, Baruch College, York College, Queens College, and John Jay College. We have three rosters per male and female volleyball and swimming team.

Our goal is to figure out if varsity swimmers are on average taller than their volleyball counterparts.
